## BME680 Sensor Setup with Python

The BME680 is an integrated environmental sensor developed specifically for mobile applications and wearables. It combines individual high linearity, high accuracy sensors for pressure, humidity, temperature, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

### Hardware Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi or a similar device.
- BME680 sensor.
- Breadboard and jumper wires (optional but useful for prototyping).


## Software Setup

1. I2C: enables support for I2C based hardware:

With root:dietpi login credentials:

Run dietpi-software from the command line.

```
dietpi-software
```
Choose Browse Software and select I2C. Finally select Install. DietPi will do all the necessary steps to install and start the software item.


```

```

2. Reboot:

```
sudo shutdown -r now

```

3. For testing purpose only, install the Python library for the BME680 sensor:

```
sudo pip3 install bme680

```


## Hardware Connection

1. Connect the BME680 sensor to your Raspberry Pi using the I2C interface. Here's a basic connection guide:

- **VCC** of BME680 to **3.3V** of Raspberry Pi
- **GND** of BME680 to **GND** of Raspberry Pi
- **SDA** of BME680 to **SDA** (GPIO2) of Raspberry Pi
- **SCL** of BME680 to **SCL** (GPIO3) of Raspberry Pi

2. (Optional) Use i2cdetect to ensure that the device is correctly connected:

```
sudo i2cdetect -y 1

```

This command should display a matrix, and one of the addresses should be 0x76 or 0x77, which represents the BME680 sensor.

Here's what you should do:

1. **Identify the correct I2C bus**:
Use the command i2cdetect -y 0 to scan the /dev/i2c-0 bus.

If you see 0x77 (or any other device address) in the output, it means your BME680 is connected to this bus. If you don't see your device address, scan the other bus with i2cdetect -y 1.

2. **Determine which bus your device is on**:
If you found your device on /dev/i2c-0, then use that in your Docker configuration. If you found it on /dev/i2c-1, then use that.

3. **Choose the correct address**:
Whether the address is 0x77 or 0x76 is determined by how the BME680's SDO pin is wired. You found 0x77, so that's the address of your BME680 on whichever I2C bus you found it.

So, for your Docker Compose configuration:

- If you found your device on /dev/i2c-0, use:

```
devices:
  - "/dev/i2c-0:/dev/i2c-0"
```
- If you found your device on /dev/i2c-1, use:

```
devices:
  - "/dev/i2c-1:/dev/i2c-1"
```

Remember, the important part is identifying which I2C bus your sensor is connected to and then configuring your software or Docker container to use that specific bus.

## Python Usage

Here's a simple Python script to read data from the BME680 sensor:

```
import bme680

sensor = bme680.BME680()

sensor.set_humidity_oversample(bme680.OS_2X)
sensor.set_pressure_oversample(bme680.OS_4X)
sensor.set_temperature_oversample(bme680.OS_8X)
sensor.set_filter(bme680.FILTER_SIZE_3)
sensor.set_gas_status(bme680.ENABLE_GAS_MEAS)

print("Temperature:", sensor.data.temperature)
print("Pressure:", sensor.data.pressure)
print("Humidity:", sensor.data.humidity)
print("Gas resistance:", sensor.data.gas_resistance)

```

Save this script, run it with Python, and it will display readings from your BME680 sensor.
