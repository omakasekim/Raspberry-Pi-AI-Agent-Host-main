**BME**

## Low power gas, pressure, temperature & humidity sensor

The BME680 is a digital 4 - in-1 sensor with gas, humidity, pressure and temperature measurement based on
proven sensing principles. The sensor module is housed in an extremely compact metal-lid LGA package with a
footprint of only 3.0 × 3.0 mm² with a maximum height of 1.00 mm (0.93 ± 0.07 mm). Its small dimensions and its
low power consumption enable the integration in battery-powered or frequency-coupled devices, such as
handsets or wearables.

Typical applications

- Indoor air quality
- Home automation and control
- Internet of things
- Weather forecast
- GPS enhancement (e.g. time-to-first-fix improvement, dead reckoning, slope detection)
- Indoor navigation (change of floor detection, elevator detection)
- Outdoor navigation, leisure and sports applications
- Vertical velocity indication (rise/sink speed)

Target Devices

- Handsets such as mobile phones, tablet PCs, GPS devices
- Wearables
- Home weather stations
- Smart watches
- Home appliances
- Navigation systems
- Gaming, e.g. flying toys
- IOT devices
